"""
Composable stream operators for session channels.

Each operator takes an iterable of events (a SessionChannelReader or
any iterator that may yield None on idle) and returns a transformed
iterator.  Operators compose naturally via nesting:

    stream = with_heartbeats(reader)
    stream = with_heartbeats(filter_events(reader, types={"complete"}))

    for event in source:
