    Orchestrator-specific delegation policy.
    
    BUSINESS RULE:
    The orchestrator should NOT delegate work to nodes on finalization paths.
    
    RATIONALE:
    The orchestrator has a special responsibility: it manages the completion
    flow programmatically. When orchestration work completes, it:
    
    1. Calls _route_to_finalizer() to send results to finalization nodes
    2. Uses topology information to find the path to output
    3. Routes results automatically without LLM involvement
    
    If the LLM could create work items for finalization path nodes, it would
    create confusion and incorrect behavior:
    
    BAD EXAMPLES:
        - LLM creates "Synthesize results" work item, assigns to "finalize" node
          → Wrong! Finalize happens automatically after completion
        
        - LLM creates "Aggregate findings" work item, assigns to "aggregator" node
          → Wrong! Aggregator is part of post-completion flow
    
    CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
        - LLM creates "Search Jira" work item, assigns to "jira_agent" node
          → Correct! This is actual work to be done
        
        - When all work completes, orchestrator automatically routes to finalize
          → Correct! This is programmatic, not delegated work
    
    WHY THIS IS ORCHESTRATOR-SPECIFIC:
    Other agent types don't have this special routing behavior. A regular
    agent might legitimately want to send results to an aggregator node
    as part of its work. Only the orchestrator has the "manage completion
    flow programmatically" responsibility.
    
    SOLID COMPLIANCE:
    - Single Responsibility: Only filters based on finalization paths
    - Open/Closed: Can be extended (e.g., add more filtering rules)
    - Liskov Substitution: Can be used anywhere DelegationPolicy is expected
    - Interface Segregation: Inherits minimal interface from base class
    - Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions (StepTopology, AdjacentNodes)

        2. The topology.finalizer_paths.distances contains the node UID
        
        The distance value indicates how many hops to reach a finalizer:
        - distance=1: Direct finalizer (writes to Channel.OUTPUT)

        - distance=N: N-1 hops to finalizer
        
        ALL of these should be excluded from delegation because they're
        part of the completion flow.
