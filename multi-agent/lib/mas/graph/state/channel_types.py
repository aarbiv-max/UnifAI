"""
State channel types for GraphState field merge behavior.

Mirrors LangGraph's channel architecture (last_value.py, binop.py):
  - LastValueChannel  → LangGraph's LastValue
  - BinOpChannel      → LangGraph's BinaryOperatorAggregate

Key difference from LangGraph: our nodes return the FULL GraphState,
not just a dict of their writes. So each channel type implements
extract_write() to infer what the node actually changed, before
applying update().

Pipeline per parallel superstep (mirrors apply_writes in _algo.py):
  1. channel.extract_write(original, result)  → the node's "write"
  2. collect all writes per field             → pending_writes_by_channel
  3. channel.update(base, [write_A, write_B]) → reconciled value

class BinOpChannel(BaseStateChannel):

    Reducer field — applies a binary operator to accumulate writes.

    Mirrors LangGraph's BinaryOperatorAggregate.

    Used for Annotated[T, reducer_fn] fields:

    extract_write uses type-aware inference so operators always receive
    the right shape of data:

      Lists — pure append (original is a prefix of modified):
          extract only the new tail items (the increment).
          e.g. [m1,m2,m3] → original=[m1,m2] → write=[m3]
          Operator sees small deltas → no duplication on parallel merge.

      Lists — in-place mutation (same length or items changed, e.g. ack_by):
          extract the full modified list.
          Operator must reconcile same-ID items (union ack_by).

      Dicts:
          extract only new or changed keys (the increment).

      Other (scalars used as BinOp, rare):
          extract the full new value.
